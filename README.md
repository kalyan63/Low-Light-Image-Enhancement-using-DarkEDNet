This is a CNN based model which includes encoder and decoder along with some connected CNN layers to enhance a low light images.
This is a supervised model which uses rmse as a loss function. We can use psnr or mae for loss as well. 
This model is mainly designed to retain most of the image features like colour and resolution. This model uses a lot less parameters than the previous SOTA models.
